# InvestIt

As part of the [InvestIt Web App](https://github.com/kfuruie/InvestGame), this repo held all of the Angular components, which was run separately from the main application. As most of the back-end of InvestIt was built in PHP, this Angular component was included for pedagogical purposes.


To use this component, we ran both this Angular component and our main web app separately, then routed towards this component for the part of our web app built in Angular.
